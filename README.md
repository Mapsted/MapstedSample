<h2>How to Set Up a Mapsted Sample Project for Android</h2>

1. Clone the Android Mapsted Sample project to your local computer. 
   `git clone https://github.com/Mapsted/MapstedSampleAndroid` 

2. Based on your need, Open `Sample_Java_Project` for java project or `Sample_Kotlin_Project` for kotlin project in Android studio.

3. Please make sure your project uses `JDK 11` or above. Depending on the android studio version, the option to set this JDK path may be in the `File > Project Structure > SDK Location` or in `Settings > Build > Gradle`.
